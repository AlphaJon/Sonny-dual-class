# General
All abilities can be learnt at level 1 and all prerequisites have been removed
All classes have access to suppression and quick strike (100% of Str, Ins and 50% Speed, is also made AoE)

# Biological
Adrenaline is now AoE.
Vicious strike now deals up to +50% extra damage based on missing health
Slash's healing reduction can now stack up to 5 times, for a total of -50% healing received. This further stacks with animalism.
Corrosion actually reduces poison defense now
Envenom can now stack up to 99 times, making poison bio scale extremely well in longer fights
Acidic blood's piercing bonus is now 350/400/450/500% instead of 520% to 670%.
Reform's heal benefits from poison piercing.
Poison moves that normally deal 10% Strength and Instinct now deal 15% Strength and Instinct.
Infect now triggers a direct attack instead of a large 1-turn DoT. While this means its damage is no longer amplified by DoT increasing effects, it also means the ability now greatly benefits from poison piercing and defense reduction. Damage scaling is now 1.5/1.65/1.8/2.0 * Strength because of its new synergy with acidic blood.
Savagery now also grants +3/6/9/12% lifesteal. 

# Hydraulic
Frost, Hypothermia, Ice wall and Slam are now AoE.
Hypothermia now also has Instinct scaling on its DoT.
Restore's heal benefits from ice piercing. Safe guard's heal benefits from physical piercing.
Regulate can now stack 10/15/20 times and you gain 5/8/11 stacks on hit, focus recovery is now 1 at all ranks per stack, now also grants +2 max focus per stack.
Warm neurology now also grants +3/6/9/12% lifesteal

# Phychological
Dark echoes' debuff can now stack twice and lasts 3 turns instead of 2, allowing you to keep both stacks by applying it once every 2 turns.
Placebo and nerve shock now scale with both Strength and Instinct
Free will's shield now refreshes properly.
Haunt is now AoE and can stack twice.
Overdrive now also grants +10% lifesteal. *Note*: doesn't work against retrograded targets, so betray/nightmare won't grant extra healing. Sacrifice should work (unconfirmed)
